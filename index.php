    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>
      This project is built upon the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate, providing a standardized, organized, and object-oriented foundation for developing high-quality WordPress plugins. It offers the flexibility to customize the boilerplate according to your needs, automatically renaming classes and files for seamless integration into your WordPress plugins folder.

    <h2>Contents</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>plugin-name</code> directory: Contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Features</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The Boilerplate is based on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API">Plugin API</a>, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards">Coding Standards</a>, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/">Documentation Standards</a>.</li>
      <li>All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.</li>
      <li>The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that corresponds both to the WordPress Plugin Repository structure and makes it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.</li>
      <li>The project includes a <code>.pot</code> file as a starting point for internationalization.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    
    <p>
      The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". It's safe to activate the plugin at this point. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types added until you write the code.
    </p>
    
    <h2>License</h2>
    
    <p>
      The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate is licensed under the GPL v2 or later.

      A copy of the license is included in the root of the pluginâ€™s directory. The file is named <code>LICENSE</code>.

    <h3>Includes</h3>
    
    <p>
      Note that if you include your own classes or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said files may go:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>plugin-name/includes</code>: Functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts of the site reside.</li>
      <li><code>plugin-name/admin</code>: All admin-specific functionality.</li>
      <li><code>plugin-name/public</code>: All public-facing functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Note that previous versions of the Boilerplate did not include <code>Plugin_Name_Loader</code>, but this class is used to register all filters and actions with WordPress. The example code provided shows how to register your hooks with the Loader class.
    </p>
