    <h2>Contents</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><code>plugin-name</code> directory: Contains the source code - a fully executable WordPress plugin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Features</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The Boilerplate is based on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API">Plugin API</a>, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards">Coding Standards</a>, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/">Documentation
                Standards</a>.</li>
        <li>All classes, functions, and variables are documented so that you know what you need to change.</li>
        <li>The Boilerplate uses a strict file organization scheme that corresponds both to the WordPress Plugin
            Repository structure and makes it easy to organize the files that compose the plugin.</li>
        <li>The project includes a <code>.pot</code> file as a starting point for internationalization.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installation</h2>

    <p>
        The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". It's safe to activate the plugin at
        this point. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, there will be no menu items, meta boxes, or
        custom post types added until you write the code.
    </p>

    <h3>Includes</h3>

    <p>
        Note that if you include your own classes or third-party libraries, there are three locations in which said
        files may go:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>plugin-name/includes</code>: Functionality shared between the admin area and the public-facing parts
            of the site reside.</li>
        <li><code>plugin-name/admin</code>: All admin-specific functionality.</li>
        <li><code>plugin-name/public</code>: All public-facing functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note that previous versions of the Boilerplate did not include <code>Plugin_Name_Loader</code>, but this class
        is used to register all filters and actions with WordPress. The example code provided shows how to register your
        hooks with the Loader class.
    </p>
